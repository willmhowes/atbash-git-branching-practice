# atbash-git-branching-practice

This is a project to practice branching with git.

Some branching commands
- 'git branch' shows current branch, as well as branch list
- 'git branch new-branch' - creates a branch caled new-branch
- 'git checkout new-branch' - checks out the branch called new-branch
- 'git push remote-name new-branch' - pushes code from branch 'branch-name' to the remote 'remote-name' (usually origin)

'I am causing trouble'
